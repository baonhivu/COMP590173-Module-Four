# COMP590173-Module-Four

For your final project, you will create and refine a design using one of the methods from our final two modules: cognitively-driven design and creative visualization opportunities workshops. You may work on a topic or problem of your choice and using a medium of your choice (physical, sketch, web, notebook, Tableau dashboard); however, the final visualization design should reflect your own work (no Tableau defaults, please) and should be reasonably polished (e.g., if you use sketch, your hand-drawn visualization should encode the actual data). You should plan to work in a group of four to five people. You can note your group hereLinks to an external site.. Please feel free to list a partial group and/or join a partial group, but make sure you get in contact with everyone in your group so that there aren't any surprises come the exam day :-) 

You will use the methods to develop an activity that you will deploy with your classmates during the final exam period. Note that you should design your activities to fit within a 30 minute window---including introduction, summary, and data collection---and the activity should fill most of that window. You will use the last hour of the exam period to analyze your activities and summarize your findings and future directions for refinement.
